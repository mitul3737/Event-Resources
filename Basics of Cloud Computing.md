# Google Cloud Certification

You won’t get a full certification exam voucher but you can get discount by taking part in     QWIKLABS Speed test . You can see an example from this post : https://twitter.com/qwiklabs/status/1407701177110695944

Resources for preparation : Learn from QWIKLABS . 
Note: But you need credit for those and thus you can follow QWIKLABS’  twitter handle and check if there is any speed test or not. If there is any then  grab it and you will get credits for the seed test and eventually you can get 1 month free subscriptions Link : https://www.qwiklabs.com/
